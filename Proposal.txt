Sales data from various countries 
The data is interesting because the data has sales from different countries which we can compare
I am interested in comparing the sales in USA with sales in other English speaking countries
We can also compare sales from year 2003, 2004 and 2005
Sales can also vary quarterly and we can compare and give some suggestions to the bussiness owner on how to improve sales in different quarters
